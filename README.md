# mdn-cli

A tiny CLI for searching the Mozilla Developer Network docs and displaying them in terminal.

```
$ mdn accept header

# Accept

The **`Accept`** request HTTP header advertises which content types, expressed as [MIME types][1], the client is able to understand. Using [content negotiation][2],
the server then selects one of the proposals, uses it and informs the client of its choice with the [`Content-Type`][3] response header. Browsers set adequate values
for this header depending on the context where the request is done: when fetching a CSS stylesheet a different value is set for the request than when fetching an
image, video or a script.
